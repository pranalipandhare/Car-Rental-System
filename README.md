# Car-Rental-System
ðŸš— Dynamic Car Rental System in Java - OOP in Action! ðŸš—

I'm thrilled to share my latest project: a dynamic Car Rental System developed using Java, showcasing the power of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This system efficiently manages car rentals, handles customer interactions, and ensures smooth return processes.
Key Features:

    Comprehensive Car Management
    Seamless Customer Interaction
    Efficient Return Management
    User-Friendly Interface

Tech Highlights:

    Encapsulation: Private data members with public getters/setters.
    Abstraction: Simplified interfaces for rental operations.
    Extensibility: Designed for future enhancements.

Check out the screenshots to see it in action! Feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback.
